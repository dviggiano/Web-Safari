COMING SOON: v2 in React and Tailwind CSS with real-time zoo data via web scraping

# <a href="https://web-safari.web.app/">Web Safari</a>

Single-page web application created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the Bulma CSS framework, and Firebase.
 
## Current Features
 * Identify zoos with exhibits for a pool of animals
 * Leave zoo reviews and feedback
 * Explore animal profiles
 * Create accounts to save favorite animals, which will automatically update the default zoo filter
 
## Planned Features
 * Administrator inbox to view messages, approve reviews, add zoos/animals directly from app interface
 * Replace zoo list with a central map; colorcode zoos based on amount of selected animals as opposed to hiding them
 * User profiles
 * Get real-time zoo data
 * Updated original graphics, including star rating reviews and animal images of a uniform style

## Design Flaws
 * This app was intended to be created with vanilla JavaScript, but could greatly benefit from a framework such as React
 * Firestore collections should have been designed more efficiently to reduce operations (such as the need for an encoder)
